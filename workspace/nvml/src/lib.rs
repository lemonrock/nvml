//! This crate provides mid-level Rust wrappers for working with persistent memory by wrapping the PMDK, Persistent Memory Development Kit (formerly NVML, and also known as pmem).

/// CTO pools are equivalent to multiple `malloc`-like (Heap) allocators

/// Object pools allow the storage of arbitrary objects, arranged in graphs or lists, with support for Mutexes, Read-Write locks, condition variables and transactions.
/// Transactions can not work on Rust currently as they use `setjmp/longjmp`.

/// Basic abstractions supporting the use of persistent memory.
/// Essential if building alternatives to the block, cto, log or object pools.
