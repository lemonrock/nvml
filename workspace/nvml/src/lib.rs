//! # nvml
//!
//! This crate provides mid-level Rust wrappers for working with persistent memory by wrapping the PMDK, Persistent Memory Development Kit (formerly NVML, and also known as pmem).
//! For more documentation, check [pmem.io](https://pmem.io).
//!
//! Persistent memory is available as 'pools', each of which can be used in a particular way.
//!
//! The most interesting modules are `cto_pool`, `block_pool`  and `log_pool`.
//! The module `persistent_memory` provides low-level support.
//! The module `object_pool` can not work well with Rust.
//!
//! The struct `Configuration` can be used to create and manage several different pools of persistent memory.
//!
