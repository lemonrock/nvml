/// This trait allows one to do memory writes with control over flushes.
/// When dropped, the memory is drained and so fully persisted.
/// This is better than using `persist()`, which forces a flush and drain every time.
/// Some types of memory (eg mmap, heap) do not allow flushes, and so flushes for these memory types do nothing.

	/// Returns a pointer to underlying memory.
