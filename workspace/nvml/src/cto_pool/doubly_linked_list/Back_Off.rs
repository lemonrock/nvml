// TODO: Possibly a better implementation: https://github.com/Qarterd/Honeycomb/blob/master/src/common/Honey/Thread/LockFree/Backoff.h
/// In fully concurrent systems the helping strategy, as well as heavy contention on atomic primitives, can downgrade the performance significantly.
/// Therefore the algorithm, after a number of consecutive failed CAS operations (ie failed attempts to help concurrent operations) puts the current operation into back-off mode.
/// When in back-off mode, the thread does nothing for a while, and in this way avoids disturbing the concurrent operations that might otherwise progress slower.
/// The duration of the back-off is initialized to some value (eg proportional to the number of threads) at the start of an operation, and for each consecutive entering of the back-off mode during one operation invocation, the duration of the back-off is changed using some scheme, eg increased exponentially.
