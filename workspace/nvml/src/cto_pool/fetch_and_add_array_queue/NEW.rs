/// Executions of the `CLFLUSHOPT` instruction are ordered with respect to fence instructions and to locked read-modify-write instructions; they are also ordered with respect to the following accesses to the cache line being invalidated: writes, executions of `CLFLUSH`, and executions of `CLFLUSHOPT`.
/// They are not ordered with respect to writes, executions of `CLFLUSH`, or executions of `CLFLUSHOPT` that access other cache lines; to enforce ordering with such an operation, software can insert an `SFENCE` instruction between `CFLUSHOPT` and that operation.

/// Executing `CLFLUSHOPT` will usually cause a TSX abort.
