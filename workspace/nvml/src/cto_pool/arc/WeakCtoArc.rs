/// `WeakCtoArc` is a version of [`CtoArc`] that holds a non-owning reference to the managed value.
/// The value is accessed by calling [`upgrade`] on the `WeakCtoArc` pointer, which returns an `Option``<`[`CtoArc`]`<Value>>`.
///
/// Since a `WeakCtoArc` reference does not count towards ownership, it will not prevent the inner value from being dropped, and `WeakCtoArc` itself makes no guarantees about the value still being present and may return `None` when [`upgrade`]d.
///
/// A `WeakCtoArc` pointer is useful for keeping a temporary reference to the value within [`CtoArc`] without extending its lifetime.
/// It is also used to prevent circular references between [`CtoArc`] pointers, since mutual owning references would never allow either [`CtoArc`] to be dropped.
/// For example, a tree could have strong [`CtoArc`] pointers from parent nodes to children, and `WeakCtoArc` pointers from children back to their parents.
///
/// The typical way to obtain a `Weak` pointer is to call [`CtoArc::downgrade`].
///
