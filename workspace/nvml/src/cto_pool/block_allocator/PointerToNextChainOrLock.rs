// This works as long as block_size >= MinimumBlockSizeInBytesToCreateSpaceForAOneByteLock && MinimumBlockSizeInBytesToCreateSpaceForAOneByteLock >= 256 && is_a_power_of_two(MinimumBlockSizeInBytesToCreateSpaceForAOneByteLock)
// Since pointers will have a minimum alignment of MinimumBlockSizeInBytesToCreateSpaceForAOneByteLock, the lowest 8 bits at least will be unoccupied.
// Union works on Intel x86-64.
// This data can be stored either within the chain itself (eg at the beginning or end of the block)
// Or it can be stored in a fixed size area as 'block / chain meta data', separate.
// We find it in the fixed size area by taking its pointer, subtracting the first pointer of the block allocator and dividing by block size to get block number (index) one based.
