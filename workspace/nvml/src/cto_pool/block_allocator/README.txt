// Option: https://github.com/nahratzah/ll
	// <https://nahratzah.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/lock-free-programming-and-formal-proofs/>
	// Code is close to impenetrable but could be converted... just.

// Option : Hardware Transactional Memory
	// Definitely do-able
	// A software implementation is maybe possible via `picotm`, but this uses `setjmp` / `longjmp` and a thread-lock
		// Indeed, most hybrid transactional memory solutions do use a thread-lock
		// We don't need to if we know which memory values we're touching
	// libitm for a composite?

// Not-So-Keen Option: Adapt Java's variation of MSQueue (ConcurrentLinkedQueue) so can delete OR adapt Java's ConcurrentDeque
	// Relies on Java GC, so might be hard to tease out.

// Lesser Option: Michael Scott (https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/#personal) has a C++ deque. Need to find how to get the source.

Using HTM

Notes from Wang, libTM:-
"to  ensure  progress,  we  implement  a
 spinlock-based  software  fallback  path  for  every  RTM  trans-
 action started. TSX will speculatively attempt to elide the spin
 locks but should any transactions abort, critical sections will be
 protected by acquiring the spin locks in software. Our imple-
 mentation  supports  both  multiple  fine-grained  spin  locks  and
 one global spin lock as the software fallback path."

LibTM seems to be here: https://github.com/mikedw/synquake_tsx/tree/master/src/lib_tm  and untouched since 2014... despite the HythTM paper.
	Code of interest seems to be here: https://github.com/mikedw/synquake_tsx/blob/d9217fb85408216c8f0c39ec85ae462109fc9940/src/lib_tm/tm_scope.cc
