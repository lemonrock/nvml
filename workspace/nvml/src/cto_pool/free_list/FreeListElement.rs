/*
The state and element structures are both public, present in the lfds711_freelist.h header file, so that users can embed them in their own structures (and where necessary pass them to sizeof). Expected use is that user structures which are to enter freelists contain within themselves a struct lfds711_freelist_element, and this is used when calling lfds711_freelist_push, and the value set in the freelist element is a pointer to the user structure entering the freelist. This approach permits zero run-time allocation of store and also ensures the freelist element is normally in the same memory page as the user data it refers to.


Once a freelist element structure has been pushed to the stack, it cannot be deallocated (free, or stack allocation lifetimes ending due to say a thread ending, etc) until lfds711_freelist_cleanup has returned



Consider populating the elimination array before first pop()
