// Architecture names based on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/90eb44a5897c39e3dff9c7e48e3973671dcd9496/src/librustc_trans/abi.rs#L925
// If changing this code, all places that use architecture alignment must be changes to, as rust does not allow the use of constants in #[repr()] statements.
// Currently this is `AlignedVariableLengthArray` and `FreeList`
// Note that the following can not be supported:-
// * msp430
// * asmjs

// nvptx, wasm32 and hexagon are guesses.

// s390x and nvptx64 are guesses.
#[cfg(any(target_arch = "mips64", target_arch = "sparc64", target_arch = "s390x"))] const AtomicIsolationSize: usize = 64;
