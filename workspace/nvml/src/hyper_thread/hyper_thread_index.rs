// NOTE: Mac OS X does not support fixed thread affinity.
// NOTE: FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and BitRig seem to have no equivalent of `sched_getcpu()`.
// NOTE: Fuschia, Haiku and Redox haven't been investigated.
// NOTE: For all modern x86_64 / x86 CPUs, it is probably possible to use CPUID but it's not straightforward. For example, RocksDb does it but there is not certainty that it handles CPUs newer than Westmere correctly: [See PhysiclCoreID](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/aba34097405f076529072fc4cffcba27dd41e73a/port/port_posix.cc) or <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33745364/sched-getcpu-equivalent-for-os-x>

/// Attempts to return a hyper thread's index.
/// Efficient, as it caches the value in a thread-local variable.
/// Useful only for algorithms requiring a hyper thread index which starts at zero.
/// Does not necessarily map to a CPU number, eg Linux's `sched_getcpu()`.
/// Once assigned for a thread, never changes.
/// Thread death will cause all sorts of problems...
