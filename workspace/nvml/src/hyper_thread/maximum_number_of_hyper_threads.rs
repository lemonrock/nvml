// NOTE: We do not use the `num_cpus` crate, because it gets the number of CPUs from thread affinity - and our thread may already have had its affinity set.
// On Linux glibc & musl, there are also the functions `get_nprocs()` and `get_nprocs_conf()` but these either use `/sys` (glibc) or delegate to `sysconf()` (musl).
